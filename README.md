### Hello! 👋

This is Yutaro's Github. (Pronounced "You-tar-roe") 

- I currently work at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Pediatric Oncology (+ Broad Institute, Cancer Program) with Drs. Gillani, Van Allen, and Janeway studying the genetic mechanisms of pediatric solid tumor cancers such as Osteosarcoma and Ewing's Sarcoma using computational biology tools.
- I graduated from Columbia Engineering in May 2023 majoring in Applied Mathematics (Quantitative Biology) and minoring in Biomedical Engineering and Philosophy.
  - During my time at Columbia, I conducted research in adverse drug events and pharmaco-genomics in the Tatonetti Lab. 

- I'm interested in using [computational biology / biomedical informatics / data science] methods to study [pediatric cancer / rare disease / precision pharmacology].
- I can be most easily reached at yutaro_tanaka [at] dfci.harvard.edu
