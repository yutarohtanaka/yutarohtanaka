### hello! ðŸ‘‹

this is yutaro's github. (pronounced "yuu-ta-roe") 

**tl;dr - yutaro tanaka is a computational biologist at dana-farber cancer institute interested in studying pediatric cancer and other rare diseases.**
**he graduated from columbia engineering, where he studied applied math/biomedical informatics**

#### about yutaro 
- i'm currently based in boston :us: (and sometimes tokyo :jp:)
- i currently work at the [dana-farber cancer institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/), department of pediatric oncology in the [gillani lab](https://gillanilab.dana-farber.org/). i'm also fortunate to be affiliated with the [van allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) and [janeway](https://janewaylab.dana-farber.org) labs at dana-farber, and the [broad institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), cancer program.
  - we aim to understand why and how rare, aggressive pediatric solid tumors (all non-blood cancers) arise, develop, and metastasize (travel and plant themselves to different parts of the body).
  - our ultimate goal is to provide insights into how these cancers happen and how we can treat them better.
  - we do this by applying computational biology methods to different kinds of "omics" (eg. genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) data.
---
- i graduated from [columbia engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/) in may 2023 majoring in applied mathematics (with a quantitative biology focus) and minoring in biomedical engineering and philosophy.
  - i was incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to do research in the [tatonetti lab](https://tatonettilab.org) working on understanding and building databases for adverse drug events and pharmacogenomics using population genomics, data science, and natural language processing.
    - check out [nsides](http://nsides.io/), a big (and machine readable) resource for drug side effects and drug interactions!
  - i'm also extremely greatful to have had the opportunity to work at the [zhao lab](https://zhaolab.rockefeller.edu/) (the rockefeller university), [sumikura lab](https://www.grips.ac.jp/list/en/facultyinfo/sumikura_koichi/) (the national graduate institute of policy studies, japan), [utec](http://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/) (university of tokyo, edge capital), [forest inc.](https://www.forest-inc.jp/), [lily medtech](https://www.lilymedtech.com/en/), and [micin](https://micin.jp/en) through various research internships. through these positions, i was fortunate to have very diverse opportunities to tackle different computational problems, develop my own research questions, contribute to quantitative academic research and strategic industry efforts, found/lead data science teams, and mentor/supervise both younger and more senior colleagues.
- before my undergraduate studies, i grew up in :jp: (osaka and nara), and :england: (cambridge and leeds).

#### my academic interests
- **i'm currently most interested in the development and application of computational/statistical methods and resources to contribute to the systematic understanding of biological mechanisms and therapeutic target discovery in pediatric and rare diseases**
  - more broadly, i'm interested in the questions that involve some intersection of 
    - **methods** : development and application of *computational biology / biomedical informatics / natural language processing / statistical genetics*
    - **resources** : development of *machine-friendly / large-scale / inclusive / representative* datasets
    - **domains** : dissection of *pediatric cancer / rare disease / precision pharmacology / biomedically underrepresented populations*
- my recent work (that has been somewhat polished) is available on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w7241CQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [orcid](https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1060-7065). more coming soon!
- i can be most easily reached at yutaro_tanaka [at] dfci.harvard.edu .
- happy to collaborate, talk anything and everything computational biology and data science! 
  - (i am also happy to talk experimental science but no guarantees...)

- another active interest of mine is the "science of science" - the application of data science to understand how to make science more interpretable, effective, predictable, and inclusive for scientists and for stakeholders.

#### my non-academic interests

- when i'm not on vscode/an llm, i can usually be found
  - triathlon-ing :bicyclist: :swimmer: :runner:
  - lounging :mahjong: :sleeping: :musical_note: :video_game: 
  - watching :soccer: :baseball: :movie_camera: :car:
  - reading :books:
  - cooking 

- i care greatly about improving equity in access to educational opportunities and mentorship, and have tried to use my free time to contribute to efforts to achieve this in different contexts.
  - co-founding [atelier basi](https://atelierbasi.com/), a non-profit, free college-prep program to assist more high school students from across japan access higher education opportunities across the globe.
    -  the program has mentored ~90 students across japan over the past 4 years, many of whom went to high schools that had never sent a student to a college / university overseas, and lacked any college counseling resources. the organization has helped them matriculate at schools across the world, including highly selective institutions. they have been awarded millions in scholarships + financial aid from private foundations and schools, many on full-rides.
    -  i'm so proud of the successes our mentees have already achieved in their academic/personal/professional lives, and hearing how new environments have allowed them to flourish. 
    -  i'm especially proud of the fact that the majority of them have returned to contibute to the organization to pay it forward to the next generation of students.
  - volunteering through [musical mentors](https://www.musical-mentors.org/) to teach violin and piano to local elementary students in new york.
  - volunteering through [project tutors](https://communityimpact.columbia.edu/our-programs/project-tutors) to assist teachers at a elementary school in new york
  - i am always eager to contribute to all kinds of efforts, please reach out if you have anything i may be a good fit for!

#### afternote 
(if you haven't noticed already) 
- *i try to not use uppercase letters unless i really have to*. 
  - i think capital letters make text look too serious. silly is better than serious.
